We are excited about your interest in joining the engineering team at Sunshine! At Lumi, we believe that the best way to evaluate your coding skills is to let your code speak for itself. With this in mind, we would like to see some of your work. While we are not prescriptive about what sort of code sample you submit, we ask that you keep the following things in mind:

- The code that you submit should reflect your work and your work alone. Please avoid submitting samples which include code that you yourself did not write.
- Similarly, please be mindful of work which could potentially be proprietary to another organization. You should be the sole owner of any code included in your submission unless the code has already been open sourced.
- Your code sample should be a project that you have worked on in the past, so long as the above applies. Please provide us with context about a) why you worked on the project, b) in what capacity, and c) on what kind of timeline. 
- We have no particular preference regarding the languages or technologies you use in your sample. Whatever you think best demonstrates your skillset is the best choice.
- We want to understand the sort of problems that you like solving. Try to select a project which showcases your particular areas of expertise and interest.
- We understand many candidates do not have recent non-proprietary code and not everyone has the ability or interest to work on side projects. That's completely OK! So long as you provide us with all the necessary context, we will evaluate your code with the timing and scope of the project in mind.
As we read through these samples, we appreciate clean and well-documented code. It will work to your advantage to provide detailed documentation.  At the very least, please provide clear instructions on how to run the code, including any software, libraries, or other dependencies that need to be preinstalled.  Also, if it's not entirely obvious what your code does, please include an explanation or video.
- Please submit your code sample via email within three business days to your recruiter. If it makes sense to do so, you can also fork the following repo:
  - https://github.com/lumilabs/SunshineSample
  - Create a remote connection back, and submit your code via a Pull Request, which will be reviewed by a team member

Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions - and good luck! We look forward to seeing your work. :)
